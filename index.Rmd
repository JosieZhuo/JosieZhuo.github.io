## Introduction

Hi! My name is Qingyue Zhuo (Josie), a first year Master student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), [Mailman School of Public Health](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/), majoring in [Biostatistics](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics). As a data driven person, I'm willing to apply my knowledge in data manipulation to real-world problems, and provide better solutions to public heath issues.

## Resume
